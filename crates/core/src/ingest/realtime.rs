//! The realtime (webhook) head of the connector model (design §5.4) — the push counterpart to the
//! pull [`Connection`]. A [`RealtimeConnection`] turns a verified webhook delivery into the *same*
//! `EventBuilder`s the poll produces, so the reconciliation poll (the correctness floor) and a
//! webhook for the same activity collapse on `UNIQUE(fingerprint)`; a dropped webhook is recovered
//! by the next poll.
//!
//! Two layers, mirroring the pull side:
//! - **App-level** [`RealtimeConnector`]: `verify` (authenticate the raw bytes against the app
//!   secret, constant-time) + `route` (credential-free peek of the routing key). Runs at the HTTP
//!   edge, *before* any connection is resolved.
//! - **Per-connection** [`RealtimeConnection`]: `accept_webhook` (body → source items) + `hydrate`
//!   (thin-notification → full item; identity for GitHub). Dispatched through [`RealtimeDispatch`],
//!   which — having **no RSS arm** — makes "route a webhook to a pull-only source" uncompilable.
